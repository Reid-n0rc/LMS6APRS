-Toolchain-
We're using COSMIC ST7's toolchain.
It's pretty old.
Quite a bit of contemporary C isn't supported.
There didn't seem to be an open-source toolchain.

-Configuring COSMIC IDE-
Project->Load(lsm6aprs.prj)
Project->WorkingDirectory(this directory)
Build->Build

-Assembly writers-
We're using the COSMIC ST7 ABI.
The first C arg is passed in register x.
The second C arg in register a.
Who would ever want more than three registers anyways?

-Adding a file to the build-
Please add new C files to both Build.bat and lsm6aprs.prj(the IDE control file).
